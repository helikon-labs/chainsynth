## How it works

ChainSynth currently is a very early version of a generative audio-visual synthesizer that works with real-time blockchain data. It currently works only with the Polkadot relay chain data.

It updates the generated audio at every finalized block as explained below.

-   Modulo of the block hash determines the root note and the scale, from the following set:
    1. C Lydian
    2. F Major
    3. D Major
    4. G Major
    5. A Major
    6. G Whole-Tone
-   Number of events in the block defines the speed of the succession of the melody notes.
-   Number of extrinsics defines the depth of reverb applied to the melody.

## Build & Run

```
git clone https://github.com/helikon-labs/chainsynth.git
cd chainsynth
npm install
npm run dev
```

ChainSynth should be running at `localhost:8080`.
